| Pruning Stage    | Directory Search| Explore the configuration of the Linux kernel's 'config' to {target}. Sequentially show each level of menuconfig's directories to identify directories related to {target}. | Delve into the settings of the Linux kernel's 'config' to achieve {target}. Present options from menuconfig's hierarchy to identify which may relate to {target}. | Navigate through the 'config' options of the Linux kernel related to {target}. Help in discerning which directories could relate to {target}. |
| Proposing Stage  | Self-explanation One | For {target_object}, analyze each of the following settings separately to determine whether they will increase or decrease {target_object} if the setting is enabled. | For {target_object}, individually review the settings listed to ascertain whether turning each one on would cause {target_object} to increase or decrease. | Investigate each setting separately for {target_object} to determine if enabling it will cause an increase or decrease in {target_object}.   |
| Proposing Stage | Self-explanation Two | Based on the analysis above, provide the options that could potentially affect {target_object} and analyse whether enabling the settings will increase or decrease {target_object}. | Given the previous analysis, pinpoint the settings that could influence {target_object} and determine whether enabling these settings would raise or lower {target_object}. | Choose settings that might affect {target_object} considering the analysis above, evaluate whether their activation will result in an increase or decrease of {target_object}. |
| Proposing Stage  | Output          | According to the above analysis, for the options that could potentially impact {target_object}, determine whether each option will increase or decrease {target_object}. | Based on the analysis provided, for the settings that may affect {target_object}, assess whether activating each one will lead to an increase or decrease in {target_object}. | Ascertain whether each option related to {target_object}, as per the analysis above, possesses the potential to positively or negatively influence {target_object}.         |
| Correction Stage | Option Modification | I modified the following option:... The boot-up error is ... Which option did I change to cause this?                                   | The following are the configuration options in the modified .config file, which resulted in errors being displayed...Please analyze and explain which option might be causing this issue. | I modified some menuconfig options as follows. After compiling the OS, the following error message appeared during boot...Please provide all the possible options related to this error from the options I modified. |
